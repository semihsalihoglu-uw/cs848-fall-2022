## Overview
The quest to build intelligent machines that are capable of logical reasoning, i.e., ones that can 
induce new information  or deduce logical rules from prior information, is as old as the field of 
computer science. Research topics motivated with this ultimate goal is at the heart of 
symbolic (as opposed to statistical) artificial intelligence and connects with many sub-fields 
of computer science, such as data management and semantic web, as well as other scientific fields,
such as linguistics. These systems are generally based on forming a knowledge base or 
knowledge graph that represent a set of facts about a real world application domain,
as well as elementary logical rules specifying constraints about the domain, as well
as an inference system that can answer questions using the base facts and the rules.
Historically, there has been several periods that have popularized the development of such 
knowledge graph-based applications. The strongest of these have been the expert systems of 1980,
the semantic web of 2000s, and the current wave of question answering in search engines, 
recommender systems, and dataset cataloging/search for extremely heterogeneous 
large public goverment and private enterprise data lakes.

This seminar will cover seminal work in the space of knowledge graph representation, querying,
management, and past and primarily modern applications that are powered by knowledge graphs.
Topics include knowledge models, ontologies, query languages, graph data management systems,
public knowledge graphs, knowledge graph embeddings, popular successful past and present
applications. 

The seminar is based on weekly paper readings and student presentations, discussions, and
a term project.
